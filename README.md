gulinalg
========

Linear algebra functions as Generalized Ufuncs.


Uses ILP64 (64-bit) LAPACK from MKL or OpenBLAS, has optional OpenMP support
to parallelize the outer gufunc loop via the `workers` argument.

Build the package
--------------------

To build with MKL, do

```
$ pip install numpy meson meson-python ninja
$ pip install mkl mkl-devel
$ pip install . --no-build-isolation -Csetup-args='-Dopenmp=gnu' -Csetup-args='-Dblas=mkl'
```

To disable the OpenMP support, remove `-Csetup-args='-Dopenmp=gnu'` from the
pip invocation.

To build with OpenBLAS, install `scipy-openblas64` instead of MKL,

```
$ pip install scipy-openblas64   # instead of mkl mkl-devel
```

generate the `pkg-config` file,

```
$ python -c'import scipy_openblas64 as sc; print(sc.get_pkg_config())' > openblas.pc
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PWD
```

and build the package

```
$ pip install . --no-build-isolation -Csetup-args='-Dopenmp=gnu' -Csetup-args='-Dblas=scipy-openblas64'
```

Test the package
----------------

```
$ python -P -c'import gulinalg as g; g.test(verbosity=2)'
```

or use the standard `pytest` invocations.

Notes about building
====================

This module is built using NumPy's configuration for LAPACK. This means that
you need a setup similar to the one used to build the NumPy you are using. If
you are building your own version of NumPy that should be the case.

OpenMP support
==============

A subset of functions currently have openMP support via a `workers` argument
that can be used to set the number of threads to use in the outer gufunc loop.

On windows MSVC-style flags will be set, otherwise GCC-style flags (-fopenmp)
are set. By default OpenMP is enabled, but if compilation of a simple test
function fails, OpenMP will be disabled,

The user can force OpenMP to always be disabled if desired by defining the
environment variable GULINALG_DISABLE_OPENMP.

On linux, linking against intel's OpenMP implementation instead of the GNU
implementation can be selected by defining GULINALG_INTEL_OPENMP. This will
cause libiomp5 and libpthread to be linked during compilation (instead of GCC's
libgomp). This should be done, for example, on MKL-based conda environments
where the intel-openmp package has been installed. For OpenBLAS-based conda
environments, the GULINALG_INTEL_OPENMP variable should not be defined.

If Intel's icc compiler is being used instead of gcc, the user should define
the GULINALG_USING_ICC environment variable. Use of icc on windows systems is
not currently supported.
